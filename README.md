  This summer I "worked" at Innora for three weeks. There I learned
  1. how to use and create SVG images
  2. use Git

  #### Description

-  The first gadget I made calculates one's BMI (Body Mass Index). The user inputs their age, gender, height and weight and their BMI is calculated. Their BMI range is then displayed. This was primarily made through JavaScript.

- The next gadget is a notepad. There the user writes down their note which comprises of the date, title, note and an image. Their is also an option to select importance. The notes are draggable. This was made through jQuery.

-  Last I made a tic-tac-toe game. It is a basic two player tic-tac-toe game. The users input their names and play normally. This application has a collection of JavaScript and jQuery.
